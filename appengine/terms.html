<p><b>Terms of Service</b> | <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Notice</a> | <a href="program_policies.html">Program Policies</a></p>

<h2>1. Your Agreement with Google</h2>

 

<p>1.1. Your use of the Google App Engine service (the "Service") is governed 
by this agreement (the "Terms"). "Google" means Google Inc., located at 1600 
Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States, and its 
subsidiaries or affiliates involved in providing the Service.</p>

<p>1.2. In order to use the Service, you must first agree to the Terms.  You 
can agree to the Terms by actually using the Service.  You understand and agree
 that Google will treat your use of the Service as acceptance of the Terms from
 that point onwards.</p>

<p>1.3. You may not use the Service if you are a person barred from receiving 
the Service under the laws of the United States or other countries including the
 country in which you are resident or from which you use the Service. You affirm
 that you are over the age of 13, as the Service is not intended for children 
under 13.</p> 

 

<h2>2.  Your Account and Use of the Service</h2>

<p>2.1. You must provide accurate and complete registration information any 
time you register to use the Service. You are responsible for the security of
 your passwords and for any use of your account. If you become aware of any 
unauthorized use of your password or of your account, you agree to notify 
Google immediately.</p> 

<p>2.2. Your use of the Service must comply with all applicable laws, 
regulations and ordinances, including any laws regarding the export of data 
or software.</p> 

<p>2.3. You agree not to (a) access (or attempt to access) the administrative
 interface of the Service by any means other than through the interface that 
is provided by Google,  unless you have been specifically allowed to do so 
in a separate agreement with Google, or (b) engage in any activity that 
interferes with or disrupts the Service (or the servers and networks which are 
connected to the Service).</p> 

 
<h2>3. Service Policies and Privacy</h2>

<p>3.1. You agree to comply with the Google App Engine Program Policies 
included available at http://code.google.com/appengine/program_policies.html 
(or such URL as Google may provide) (the "Program Policies") which is 
incorporated herein by this reference and which may be updated from time 
to time.</p> 

<p>3.2. The Service shall be subject to the privacy policy for the Service 
available at http://code.google.com/appengine/privacy.html (or such URL as 
Google may provide), which references and incorporates Google's privacy 
policy available at http://www.google.com/privacy.html. You agree to the 
use of your data in accordance with Google's privacy policies.</p>    

<p>3.3. You agree that you will protect the privacy and legal rights 
of the users of your application.  You must provide legally adequate 
privacy notice and protection for those users.  To do so, at a minimum, 
you must incorporate the privacy terms available at 
http://code.google.com/appengine/privacy.html  into the privacy policy 
for your application.  If the users provide you with user names, 
passwords, or other login information or personal information, you 
must make the users aware that the information will be available to 
your application and to Google.</p> 

<p>3.4. If the user provides you with Google Account information, 
you may only use that information to access the user's Google Account 
when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you 
permission to do so.</p> 


<h2>4. Fees for Use of the Service</h2>

<p>4.1. Subject to Section 12 of the Terms, the Service is provided 
to you without charge for up to 500MB of disk storage, 10GB incoming bandwidth 
per day, 10GB outgoing bandwidth per day, 200 million megacycles of CPU per 
day and 2,000 emails per day. These quotas will be know as the "Fee Threshold". 
Google reserves the right to change this quota at its discretion.</p> 

<p>4.2. Google may change its fees and payment policies for the Service 
with ninety (90) days prior notice. Changes to the fees or payment policies 
will be posted at http://code.google.com/appengine/terms.html (or such other 
URL Google may provide from time to time). Any outstanding balance becomes 
immediately due and payable upon termination of the Terms for any reason and 
any collection expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by Google will 
be included in the amount owed.</p> 

<h2>5. Content in the Service and Take Down Obligations</h2> 

<p>5.1.  You understand that all information (such as data files, 
written text, computer software, music, audio files or other sounds, 
photographs, videos or other images) to which you may have access as 
part of, or through your use of, the Service are the sole responsibility 
of the person from which such content originated. All such information 
is referred to below as the "Content." The term Content shall specifically 
exclude the web application that you create using the Service and any 
source code written by you to be used with the Service (collectively, 
the "Application").</p> 

<p>5.2. Google reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to 
pre-screen, review, flag, filter, modify, refuse or remove any or all 
Content from the Service. You agree to immediately take down any Content 
that violates the Program Policies, including pursuant to a take down 
request from Google. In the event that you elect not to comply with a request 
from Google to take down certain Content, Google reserves the right to 
directly take down such Content or to disable the Application.</p> 

<p>5.3.  In the event that you become aware of any violation of the 
Program Policies by an end user of the Application, you shall immediately 
terminate such end user's account on your Application. Google reserves the 
right to terminate end user Google accounts or disable the Application in 
response to a violation or suspected violation of the Program Policies.</p> 

<p>5.4. You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google 
has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) the Application 
or any Content that you create, transmit or display while using the 
Service and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or 
damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.</p> 


<p>5.5. You agree that Google has no responsibility or liability for 
the deletion or failure to store any Content and other communications 
maintained or transmitted through use of the Service. You further 
acknowledge that you are solely responsible for securing and backing 
up your Application and any Content.</p> 

<h2>6. Proprietary Rights</h2> 

<p>6.1. You acknowledge and agree that Google (or Google's licensors) 
own all legal right, title and interest in and to the Service, including 
any intellectual property rights which subsist in the Service (whether 
those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world 
those rights may exist).</p> 

<p>6.2. Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Google, nothing
 in the Terms gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names, trade
 marks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand 
features.</p> 

<p>6.3. Except as provided in Section 8, Google acknowledges and agrees that 
it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under these 
Terms in or to any Content or the Application that you create, submit, post, 
transmit or display on, or through, the Service, including any intellectual 
property rights which subsist in that Content and the Application (whether 
those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those 
rights may exist). Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Google, you

Engine Software, or otherwise transfer any part of your rights to use 
the Software.</p> 

<p>7.4. Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the Service

<p>10.2. You may discontinue your use of the Service at any time. Google may, 
at any time, terminate your use of the Service if (A) you have breached any provision 
of the Terms (or have acted in manner which clearly shows that you do not intend to,

you is, or becomes, unlawful). Further, Google may terminate your use of the 
Service for any reason with ninety (90) days prior written notice.</p> 

<p>10.3. If Google suspends or terminates your use of the Service with cause

upon receipt of a valid DMCA notice. For more information, please go 
to http://www.google.com/dmca.html.</p>

(or such other URL Google may provide from time to time).</p> 

<h2> 15.    Other Content</h2> 

<p> 15.1. The Services may include hyperlinks to other web sites or content 
or resources or email content.  Google may have no control over any web sites 
or resources which are provided by companies or persons other than Google.</p>

available from, such web sites or resources.</p> 


<h2> 16.    Changes to the Terms</h2>

<h2> 17.    General Legal Terms</h2>

services which Google may provide to you under a separate written 
agreement), and completely replace any prior agreements between 
you and Google in relation to the Service.</p> 

<p> 17.2. There are no third party beneficiaries to these Terms.

these Terms will control if there is any conflict. </p> 

<p> 17.4. You agree that Google may provide you with notices, including 
those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or 
postings on the Service.</p> 

<p> 17.5. You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal 
right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which Google has the 
benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal 
waiver of Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be 
available to Google.</p> 

<p> 17.6. Google shall not be liable for failing or delaying performance of 
its obligations resulting from any condition beyond its reasonable control, 
including but not limited to, governmental action, acts of terrorism, 
earthquake, fire, flood or other acts of God, labor conditions, power 
failures, and Internet disturbances.</p> 

<p> 17.7. The Terms, and your relationship with Google under the Terms, 
shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without 
regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to 
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the 
county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising 
from the Terms. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still 
be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of 
urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</p>
